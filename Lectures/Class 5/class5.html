    <h2>What is Git ?</h2>
    <p>
      Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed
      to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and
      efficiency. Git relies on the basis of distributed development of a
      software where more than one developer may have access to the source code
      of a specific application and can modify changes to it which may be seen
      by other developers. Initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds
      for Linux kernel development in 2005. Every git working directory is a
      full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking
      capabilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git
      allows a team of people to work together, all using the same files. And it
      helps the team cope up with the confusion that tends to happen when
      multiple people are editing the same files.

    <h2>What is Github</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub, developed in 2008, is a web application that hosts Git
      repositories. The team that started GitHub saw that Git could solve
      important problems for many teams â€“ but Git itself is often difficult to
      use. GitHub adds a bunch of collaboration and exploration tools on top of
      Git to help you (and your team) be more productive. For instance, GitHub
      makes it easy to share code between multiple computers and developers.
      It's become the centralized organization tool of the open-source community
      and, in turn, is used by thousands of companies and teams. Some GitHub
      users have one repo they work with every day, some have hundreds. Some of
      the most important tools GitHub layers on top of Git include: Pull
      Requests which are a way for developers to propose changes and solicit
      feedback/discussion from other developers (called Code Review). Issues
      which developers use to track bugs, enhancements, or other requests that
      are associated with a given repository.
