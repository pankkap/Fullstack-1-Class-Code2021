    <h1>HTML Basics</h1>
    <p>
      While getting started with HTML, you will likely encounter new and often
      strange terms. Over time you will become more and more familiar with all
      of them, but the three common HTML terms you should begin with are
      elements, tags, and attributes. Elements: Elements are designators that
      define the structure and content of objects within a page. Some of the
      more frequently used elements include multiple levels of headings
      (identified as &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt; elements) and paragraphs
      (identified as the p element); the list goes on to include the a, div,
      span, strong, and em elements, and many more.

      A basic HTML page is a document that typically has the file extension
      .html, though HTML frequently appears in the content of other file types
      as well. All HTML documents follow the same basic structure so that the
      browser that renders the file knows what to do. Before you can start
      adding content to your document, there's a basic structure you need to set
      up in your file. This structure isn't only required for your document to
      be compliant but will also allow you to provide useful information about
      your document. The basic structure of any HTML document consists of the
      following sections or elements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The DTD (!DOCTYPE declaration).</li>
      <li>The main container (html element).</li>
      <li>The body section (body element).</li>
      <li>The head section (head element).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Doctype</h2>
    <p>
      Doctype: The first line of code, !DOCTYPE html, is called a doctype
      declaration and tells the browser which version of HTML the page is
      written in. In this case, weâ€™re using the doctype that corresponds to
      HTML5, the most up-to-date version of the HTML language. There are a
      number of different doctype declarations that correspond to various
      versions of HTML.
    </p>
    <h2>Html Element</h2>

    <p>
      HTML Root Element: Next, the html element wraps around all of the other
      code and content in our document. This element, known as the HTML root
      element, always contains one head element and one body element.
    </p>
    <h2>Head Element</h2>
    <p>
      Head Element: The HTML head element is a container that can include a
      number of HTML elements that are not visible parts of the page rendered by
      the browser. These elements are either metadata that describe information
      about the page or are helping pull in external resources like CSS
      stylesheets or JavaScript files.
    </p>
    <h2>Body Element</h2>
    <p>
    Body Element: There can only be one <body> element in an HTML document because this element is the container that holds the content of the document. All of the content that you see rendered in the browser is contained within this element. In the example above, the content of the page is a headline and simple paragraph.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
