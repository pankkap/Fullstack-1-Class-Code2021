    <h2>Front-End</h2>
    <p>
      The Term Front-End Everything you have ever seen on the web is considered
      ‘front end’. Front end is what we see when we open a web page or app. Code
      is downloaded from a server and is rendered to the screen by a web
      browser. What happens when we interact with the code is also considered
      front end. This is often referred to as the ‘Presentation Layer’ or
      ‘Client’ in software development terms. The front end is built out of
      three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML allows us to put content
      on our page: text, headers, images, buttons, links, and etc. CSS is used
      to style our page. It allows the contents to have different text colors,
      background colors, as well as dealing with the positioning of the content
      on the page. JavaScript makes our page dynamic. It allows for the content
      to change on a mouse hover or click and also lets us submit data and have
      data rendered on our page (such as submitting a new blog post or having
      your feed populated when you open Facebook).
    </p>
    <h2>Back-End</h2>
    <p>
      The Term Back-End This term usually refers to what happens ‘behind the
      scenes’: servers, databases, etc. The back end is the place we don’t see
      as users. This consists of data storage (databases) and servers running to
      provide data for the front end. Back end can be a little harder to
      imagine, especially for someone without much experience with it. Back end
      is commonly referred to as the ‘data access layer’ or ‘server’ within
      software development terms. The back end computes the data and content
      sent to the front end to be used and displayed by your browser. Back end
      server code can be written using JavaScript. However, it can be also
      written using many other languages, such as Ruby, Java, or Python. The
      database logic required in back end development often utilize a database
      language, such as SQL or MongoDB.
    </p>
    <h2>Fullstack</h2>
    <p>
      The Term FullStack It refers to the development of both front end (client
      side) and back end (server side) portions of web application. Full stack
      web developers have the ability to design complete web application and
      websites. They work on the frontend, backend, database and debugging of
      web application or websites. Full stack can apply to a web stack, mobile
      stack, or a native application stack (i.e. software programs for specific
      devices). What skills require to become a full stack developer? You’ll
      typically see a mix of front and back end skills listed on full stack web
      developer job listings, including: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Ideally, one or
      more third-party library like ReactJS or Angular Programming languages and
      libraries like Ruby, PHP, Python Experience with databases Version control
      Knowledge of security concerns and best practices Ideally, some knowledge
      of web or visual design, plus user experience best practices
